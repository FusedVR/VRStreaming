# Changelog
All notable changes to com.unity.renderstreaming package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.0] - 2021-09-13

### Added

- Added a new ClientStreamer.cs file that is responsible for managing the streams for a given player
- Added a new BlockchainData.cs script to make it easier to integrate with new Block Chain integrations with client
- It is now possible to send Blockchain transactions to each client and wait for a response from the blockchain

### Changed

- **MAJOR** Revised the Render Streaming Service prefab. The new prefab is a single game object and now requires player prefabs, which will be spawned when a player connects. This change was made to support multi-players / devices
- Upgraded to Render Streaming version : 3.1.0-exp.1
- VRInputManager now listens for Blockchain data and passes along to the BlockchainData script. 
- VRBroadcast now exposes a Max Connection / Player Prefab field in addition to GameID (see README for more details).

## [0.4.1] - 2021-08-23

### Changed

- Reverting changes where left and right eye are combined due to encoder bug that limits the size of the video render texture. This is expected to be fixed soon and once fixed, will revert this change to a single video stream. 

## [0.4.0] - 2021-08-17

### Changed

- **MAJOR** Combined left eye and right eye into a single render texture on one video track to increase encoding performance & maintain synconization between eyes
- Removed Video Resizing as this implementation needs to be re-evaluated
- Increased default resolution to 2700 x 1500 (both eyes)

### Added

- Added new VRCamStreaming component that exposes bitrate and framerate encoder parameters

## [0.3.0] - 2021-08-10

### Changed

- Listen for Camera Resolution Data about the connected VR headset and dynamically update resolution accordingly

### Added

- Added New GameID to allow the ability to filter for clients looking for a specific game

## [0.2.1] - 2021-07-18

### Changed
